If you are a fan of the retro color combination and care less about the comfort level, get them.   Now, let’s talk about the downsides. The sizing is off. I’m usually a w7.5 (on a slightly loose end), but these are way too long!! The width is narrower than the original Samba. The top of the tongue is really stiff, making it very uncomfortable to walk. Also, the nylon upper looks a little cheap and does not hold the shape of the shoes as good as the leather. You’ll see in the photo that the shape seems a little collapsed/wrinkly at the nylon area (the front maroon area).  So, I returned the 7.5 and ordered a size 7. The size 7 fits much better and is more comfortable. I haven’t walked around with them to see if the top of the tongue hurts the back of my feet. I hope they won’t because I truly like the design and color.",True,4,[],4,0

So instead of getting a women’s size 8, which is what I usually wear in other styles, for this shoe, I ordered a 7 1/2, because again these are a little tricky with the size!  when they come out you should definitely try to buy two pair if you can so that you can check the sizing!

I really wanted to keep the shoe since I know they won’t be in stock for a while.  They didn’t offer a discount on the shoe, but a good faith offer on another pair.  Very disappointment since other known brands would happily give a discount for a damaged/defect on the shoe that you are willing to keep.

I’m usually a size 8 in this type of casual shoe, and I got the 8, but it seems slightly short on my right foot. For reference I’m also a size 8 on Stan Smith’s. It fits very exact on my foot with thin socks and I just prefer a bit more room, but the leather might loosen up with time. Can’t exchange them cause this color sells out really fast. Would probably get another color later on and size up to 8.5 to see the difference and maybe add my regular insoles for more cushion (I do prefer a bit more cushion than what the shoes come with, but it does have some).

1609,mmmcab,Order normal size or half size down,"April 4, 2024","The sizing reviews were kind of all over the place for this shoe so I ordered my normal size 9 as well as an 8.5 and a 9.5. Many of the reviews said they run small, but I find that surprising as my normal size 9 was quite roomy, though not uncomfortably so. If I had only bought the 9 and had nothing to compare it to I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but I did try on the 8.5 and was surprised to find that they also fit really well. A bit snug, but in the way that Converse chucks are meant to fit snug, so they didn't feel small by any means and my toe was not pushing up against the toe box or anything. I'm unsure of which size to keep but I think I'll keep the 8.5 as I get the impression these might loosen up over time. All that said, I suppose I'd suggest ordering either TTS or a half-size down depending on how you like your shoes to fit.  If you have particularly wide feet, these might not be the shoe for you or you should consider sizing up, but for normal or narrow feet these are great. I have normal feet that are perhaps ever-so-slightly narrow, and the shoes fit fine, even the half size down.  I read other reviews that complained about the tongue; squeaking, or discomfort on the inside of the shoe digging into the toes. I did not experience either of these things personally.  My only complaint is that I wish there was even a tiny bit of arch support as it feels my foot dips inwards a bit, but they're otherwise very comfortable and incredibly cute! They are very lightweight as advertised and just a really subtle but cool and eye-catching shoe. Perfect tennis shoes for the summer!",True,5,[],7,0
1610,AdidasNerd,SIZE UP! Narrow toe box even for narrow feet.,"April 4, 2024","So adidas always runs a little big, as many of you already know. My feet are small, not wide at all, and my regular size was WAY too tight in the toe box and hurt my feet after only minutes of trying on. Returning. I am going to try and order a 1/2 size bigger and hope for the best. Hoping I don't have to go a full size bigger! I'm a true women's 6.5 and 90% of the time in adidas I size DOWN by 1/2 size and still have wiggle room for a great fit. This is NOT the case with these shoes. Also ordered the men's black&white SL 72 RS in a men's 5/women's 6 and they fit as most adidas do on me... wiggle room for toes and a perfect fit! The size 6 in the women's SL 72 OG style not only fits TOTALLY DIFFERENT (way too small) but they look very different as well. Honestly I like the construction of the men's RS style way better. I wish the green/white/gold colorway came in those instead of these. But I just love the colorway of this shoe so much I'm going to keep trying! Hope this helps someone!",True,4,[],5,0
1611,Zmoney,BEST. ADIDAS. EVER.,"April 4, 2024","Super comfy right out the box with a cushy sole and feather light on your feet!! The red and white/cream colorway is giving EVERYTHING I needed! I had zero problems with it feeling narrow and I ordered my regular size 9.5 women’s. My foot is 10 cm wide when standing which typically means I need a wide in narrow women’s shoes, but these fit perfectly! They are slightly less cushioned in the sole than the men’s SL 72, but still plenty comfy. The details on the toe are also more rounded and make my feet look smaller than in the men’s (but I really like both versions…just depends on your style/preference). Hands down my favorite pair of Adidas to date ( I have about six). I prefer them over the Samba’s (which have an uncomfortable leather tongue) and over the Gazelle’s (which are heavier). I also love that the tongue on this shoe is NOT too long or stiff and uncomfortable. It’s made of some kinda soft leather material that molds and moves with your ankle and has this embossed texture that looks cool and makes the tongue more pliable. 1000/10. If it’s in stock in your size BUY IT.",True,5,[],2,0

1613,Leesa,LOVE,"April 3, 2024","I cannot love these shoes more. First off I’ve been looking for the perfect red shoes for a long time so I was very pleased by the color choices. Then they arrived and I was blown away. Everything in a shoe I’ve always wanted and some things I didn’t know I needed. They are very light weight, low profile, slim, sleek, no bulk whatsoever. There is a slight stretch to them which relieves any pressure points in the toe area or if your feet tend to swell. They look beautiful, can be sporty, great for work, or dressed up. They’re unique and modern but with a vintage homage that I love. There is a slight arch support, I typically wear flat shoes so I’m not sure if I love this or hate it, just something new for me.   Only concerns: If you have wide feet these may not be for you, I have tiny narrow feet and they hug like a glove.  Order the correct size. These are women’s and I typically order men’s so I messed up my first try. But once I got it right they are true to your regular adidas size.  Longevity: The last few adidas I purchased wore out after only a couple months, I’ll see how these hold up. Hopefully for the price and how much I adore them they keep well.",True,5,[],2,0

1634,Eirroc,Love style but tongue has a major design flaw.,"February 18, 2024","I love the style of these, and the color way of the blue with mint laces & stripes. I ordered a half size larger than I thought I’d wear, and am glad I did because the toe box is narrow and shallow. The shallow part is somewhat problematic because of the way the tongue is constructed. It’s a weirdly stiff, plasticky feeling material and at the base of it where it’s stitched in, it leaves what feels like an inch of the “fabric?” “material?” extending into the toe box. Because this material is stiffer than fabric or leather, and it’s not stitched down, it doesn’t flex that well and every step I take pushes the edge of that extra flap of tongue material into the top of my toes, causing pain in the joint at the base of my big toenail. If it were not for this design flaw, I would find this shoe to be almost perfect (arch support would be great too! But the tongue material and construction is not comfortable at all.) I’m going to see if my local shoe repairman can slice off the extra flap of tongue material closer to the stitching, to relieve the pressure and make these wearable and comfortable, because they’re too good looking to send back!",True,4,[],5,0
